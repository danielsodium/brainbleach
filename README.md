# Implementing DSA in C

I really enjoy learning about data structures and algorithms, and I think the advancement of LLMs have caused me to lose some of the joy I found in understanding how the fundamentals worked.

I can guarentee no AI slop will make it in here but there may be some human written monstrocities.
